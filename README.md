**AMQP Sidecar** is a lightweight, configurable Elixir application designed to act as a sidecar for consuming and publishing messages via AMQP (e.g., RabbitMQ). It integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes and supports dynamic configuration for exchanges, queues, and routing keys.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **📥 Consume Messages**: Dynamically subscribe to AMQP exchanges and queues based on configuration.
- **📤 Publish Messages**: Publish messages to AMQP exchanges with optional headers.
- **⚙️ Configurable**: Define exchanges, queues, routing keys, and endpoints in a `broker.json` file.
- **🐳 Kubernetes-Friendly**: Designed to run as a sidecar in Kubernetes with configuration mounted as a ConfigMap.
- **🚀 HTTP API**: Expose an HTTP API for publishing messages and health checks.
- **🧩 Extensible**: Easily extendable to support custom message processing and forwarding logic.

---

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Elixir** (1.12 or later)
- **RabbitMQ** (3.8 or later)
- **Kubernetes** (optional, for running as a sidecar)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alesima/amqp_sidecar.git
   cd amqp_sidecar
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   mix deps.get
   ```

3. Configure the application:
   - Copy the example config and edit it:
     ```bash
     cp config/broker.json.example config/broker.json
     ```
     (or mount it as a ConfigMap — see Kubernetes below).
   - Example `broker.json`:
     ```json
     {
       "rules": [
         {
           "exchange": "test_exchange",
           "exchangeType": "topic",
           "queue": "test_queue",
           "routingKeys": ["test.*"],
           "endpointUri": "http://test-endpoint"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
   Supported `exchangeType` values: `topic` (default), `direct`, `fanout`,
   `x-delayed-message` (requires `exchangeArguments: {"x-delayed-type": "<type>"}`).
   Messages are matched by exchange plus AMQP topic patterns (`*` = one word,
   `#` = zero or more words). Unmatched messages are acknowledged and dropped
   with a warning; failed forwards are rejected with requeue.

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mix run --no-halt
   ```

---

## 🚦 Usage

### Consuming Messages

The sidecar automatically consumes messages from the configured exchanges and queues. Messages are forwarded to the specified `endpointUri`.

### Publishing Messages

Use the HTTP API to publish messages:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/publish \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "exchange": "test_exchange",
    "routingKey": "test.key",
    "message": "Hello, world!",
    "headers": {
      "x-delay": 5000
    }
  }'
```

### Health Check

Check the health of the sidecar:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/health
```

## 🐳 Running in Kubernetes

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t amqp_sidecar:latest .
   ```

2. Deploy to Kubernetes:
   - Create a ConfigMap for `broker.json`:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: ConfigMap
     metadata:
       name: amqp-sidecar-config
     data:
       broker.json: |
         {
           "rules": [
             {
               "exchange": "test_exchange",
               "exchangeType": "topic",
               "queue": "test_queue",
               "routingKeys": ["test.*"],
               "endpointUri": "http://test-endpoint"
             }
           ]
         }
     ```
   - Deploy the sidecar:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: apps/v1
     kind: Deployment
     metadata:
       name: amqp-sidecar
     spec:
       replicas: 1
       template:
         spec:
           containers:
             - name: amqp-sidecar
               image: amqp_sidecar:latest
               volumeMounts:
                 - name: config-volume
                   mountPath: /app/config
           volumes:
             - name: config-volume
               configMap:
                 name: amqp-sidecar-config
     ```
